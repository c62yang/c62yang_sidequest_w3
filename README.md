## Description

This p5.js project is an interactive, multi-screen story game that uses a state-based structure to manage different scenes. The player progresses through a series of multiple-choice decisions that influence a tracked player stat called karma. Each decision branches the narrative slightly and contributes to the final outcome.

The game demonstrates how to separate logic across multiple files, manage game states, and create simple UI interactions using mouse input. Depending on the player’s choices, they will reach either a win or lose ending.
